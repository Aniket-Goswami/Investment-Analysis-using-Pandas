# Investment-Analysis-using-Pandas
I did this project at MedTourEasy.
The project involved running an analysis on financial data using Python.
Sock data for Amazon and Facebook for the year 2016-17 was provided in CSV files along with the index data for the same year. The goal was to decide if Facebook or Amazon shares should be bought based on a simple ratio analysis using Sharpe ratio.
I used Python packages Pandas and NumPy to achieve this goal.
